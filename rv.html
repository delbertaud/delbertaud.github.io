The goal of this van is not so much van life but rather comfortable traveling without needing hotel rooms. We very much enjoy exploring the vast expanses of America.<br>

<ul>
    <li>Van was purchased brand new in March 2021. The van is a 2021 Ford Transit 350 Passenger Van.</li>
    <li>Immediately removed and sold the seats.</li>
    <li>Added limo tinting to prevent people from being able to see in the van.</li>
    <li>Wife custom made insulated blackout shades out of reflective material for every window. This creates 100% privacy and allows no light in. We found that the limo tinting still allowed light in. We were being distrubed by the street lights in rest stops and by the sun coming up in the morning.</li>
    <li>A divider shade out of a light grey material that matches the van's interior color that separates the drivers area from the rear. This allows the rear to be used for the port-a-potty bathroom while traveling or stopped where people might be able to see in the front window. It seconds as a movie screen for when we stop at night. I still need to test this by moving the seats forward and playing with a movie projector.</li>
    <li>A small DLP movie projector and portable rechargeable battery system so we can watch TV and movies when stopped.The battery on the projector lasts about 100 minutes but when I connect it to the rechargeable battery system it can last something like 5 hours. Then the battery system can be recharged the next day while driving via the van's power plug.</li>
    <li>We purchased a 5 gallon Port-a-potty and mounted it to a board. That board is then secured to the floor of the van. We learned the hard way that everything must be secured.</li>
    <li>We got 4 study storage containers and used that for storage and for the support of the bed. On top of the storage containers we put 3/4" plywood that we cut in half and put a piano hinge down the middle.</li>
    <li>On top of the platform we put a full size 10 inch memory foam mattress that we purchased off Amazon. Around the mattress we filled in the gaps with a heavy foam. This secures the position of the mattress and makes the bed fill the entire width of the rear of the van.</li>
    <li>In the very rear I had larger blocks of foam cut that creates a small headboard and protects the rear of the van. The idea was if we were hit in the rear we didn't want the platform to hit the interior of the van and cause any damage. Wife also had a small fear that if our heads were near or touching the rear doors and we were hit while parked that we could be injured. The 12 inch foam headboard solves both those issues and makes it look pretty cool.</li>
