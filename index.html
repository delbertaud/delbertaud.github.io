									<h2>Bio of Delbert Aud</h2>
									<p>Professional Programmer and Technology Consultant</p>
									<p class="story">
										My name is Delbert Aud. Have you ever met that one person who devotes the majority of their time working and 
										engaging their lives with Advanced Technologies? I am that person. I enjoy dedicating my time to reading and 
										tinkering with the things that companies, managers and other developers will soon desire. Many of these 
										cutting edge advancements become astonishing once they are understood. Meanwhile, I get the luxury of pulling 
										my hair out trying to find uses of these advancements and being able to explain them in the simplest of terms.
									</br></br>
										Teaching and mentoring others is where my true passion lies. Not too long ago, I came to the realization that 
										no matter how good of a programmer I may become, there will always be many other brilliant programmers right 
										behind me. Technology is advancing at such an expeditious rate that it makes it almost impossible for anyone 
										to keep up with it. This is one of the many reasons that I have chosen to become a technologist. In my mind, 
										a technologist is a person who concentrates on technology itself. Others may be spending their quality time 
										learning a business or an industry such as banking. However I choose to devote my time to the computer 
										industry and how to make advancements ready for use by others.
